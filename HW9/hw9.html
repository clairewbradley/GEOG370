<h1>Homework 9: California Average Tax Rates By County Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Claire Bradley</h2>
<h3>This map shows the average tax rate per county in California. I am interested in living in California in the future so was curious to know the differences in rates. I found this data on the California government website linked below but had to convert it to a CSV and average the tax rates since they varied by county district. </h3>
