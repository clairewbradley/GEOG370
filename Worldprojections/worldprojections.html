    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>For each map I loaded the new EPSG, added the distortions from the plug-in and adjusted coloring/sizing appropirately.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is distorted both in size and width near the poles. Areas are larger than they actually are and wider in these spots.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/4326.png">
    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is distorted in at the poles, especially around the sides. The poles are stretched taller than they normally would be and the sides of the map are stretched wider.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54043.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #1</h2>
    <h3>This map greatly maintains distances at the cost of distorting areas heavily. The poles have areas that are far larger than they actually should be.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG 3857.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG 3857.png" alt="Projection" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #2</h2>
    <h3>This map preserves distances and direction at the cost of enlarging some areas near the poles.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG 53018.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG 53018.png" alt="Projection" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #3</h2>
    <h3>This map is formed from a cylinder. The middle of the map is very accurate with the area being stretched widely at the poles. Direction is well-preserved from this map. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG 54034.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG 54034.png" alt="Projection" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #4</h2>
    <h3>This map is formed spherically and therefore is more distorted the further to the outside of the circle. Area and distance are not well-represented.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG 54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG 54027.png" alt="Projection" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Projection #5</h2>
    <h3>This map is very similar to the last with the same distortions. Direction is well-preserved.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/EPSG 102016.png">
    <img src=".//maps/EPSG 102016.png" alt="Projection" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Choice Projection #1</h2>
    <h3>This map is similar to "Projection #1" in that there is large aerial distortion near the poles. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Map 1.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Map 1.png" alt="Choice" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Choice Projection #2</h2>
    <h3>This map is unique and appears to be formed cyclindrically. Distortions of land areas are prevalent while a more spherical shape remains.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Map 2.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Map 2.png" alt="Choice" width='500px'>
