<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Claire Bradley</h2>
<h3>This map shows the number of new businesses in each county popping up in the past 12 months. This dataset is specifically from 2018. I was really interested in this because I hypothesized that the counties with college towns would have more new businesses because there is so much turnover and there is always a market for new goods and services changing with the trends. I also figured that metro areas would have similar trends to college towns for the same reason. The data in the map showed that this was true. It would be interesting to compare this to post-COVID data as well. </h3>
